You're Watching The Official 4k Video Of Weapon Of Choice by Fatboy Slim 
 
Arguably Fatboy Slimâ€™s most famous music video of all time, Weapon Of Choice features Christopher Walken dancing around a deserted hotel lobby. The Spike Jonze-directed video won multiple awards at the 2001 MTV music video awards and won the 2002 Grammy award for best music video. The track features vocals by the legendary Bootsy Collins.  

To mark the track's 20th anniversary, the video has been lovingly - and painstakingly - restored from the original 35mm film to produce this truly stunning 4k version that befits one of the greatest music videos of all-time.
