"Baubles, bangles and beads" by Frank Sinatra & Tom Jobim. 

This song was recorded in 1967 and was featured in the Reprise album "Francis Albert Sinatra & Antonio Carlos Jobim". 
Sinatra had already recorded this song once in 1958 for the 1959 Capitol album "Come Dance with Me!". 

I do not own the music.
