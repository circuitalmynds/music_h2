00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.420
Perish the pain

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.300
I was impoverished
Those ties that wind

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.720
And stared into open lanes

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:41.520
Stared into long long nights
Howling and still

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.900
West of the Eastern Cove
Carving the wind

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:55.920
Dawn of your eyes
Dust off your smile

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.460
When you say ‘us’
You make me trust

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:14.260
I will never keep you from an open door
I know, you know

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:27.140
That’s how much i feel in everything you are
You know, I know

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.920
Hot as the day

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.820
When we sat on stones
Watching the fish, run

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.220
Under our feet, and flow

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.520
And dove from the rocks
Scraping my knees and toes

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.580
And blood, with me, rose
Slow from the sea

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.140
And you were waiting for me

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:10.680
Waiting for me
Waiting for me
Waiting for me

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.080
You were waiting for me

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.740
It’s just how much
When you say ’us’

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.460
You don’t know just how much
You make me trust

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:37.920
I will never keep you from an open door
I know, you know

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:51.660
That’s how much i feel in everything you are
I know, I know

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:06.820
I will never keep you from an open door
i know, you know

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:22.640
I will never keep you from just who you are
I know, I know
