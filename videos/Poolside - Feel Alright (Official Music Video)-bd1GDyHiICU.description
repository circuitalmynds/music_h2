The theme of 'Feel Alright' is about making the best of a subpar situation. More specifically in this video, it's about being stuck in a life that's not how you envisioned and still striving to find happiness and purpose.  Skateboarding is used in a surreal way to symbolize Braydonâ€™s attempt to escape his complacency by hitting the open road, yet the more he travels the more he goes nowhere fast. He can't outrun himself or his life, however, along the way he lets go of the past. Braydon ultimately embraces the present and feels the satisfaction of living life in the moment, independent of external circumstances.
